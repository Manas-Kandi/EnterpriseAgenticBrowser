## Browser Terminal: A Natural Language Operating System for the Web

Transform the browser into an operating system with a built-in terminal. 
Instead of clicking buttons on websites, type commands in natural language and 
let an autonomous agent execute complex, parallel workflows across multiple tabs.

**End Goal:** Enable anyone to automate web tasks—from data extraction to 
multi-step workflows—by simply describing what they want, without coding or 
manual clicking.

**Philosophy:** The browser should be as powerful as your operating system's 
terminal. One command. Parallel execution. Autonomous completion.
